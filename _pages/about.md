I am a physics graduate student at Ohio State University studying experimental condensed matter in the Johnston-Halperin Group. My research focuses on an organometallic coordination compound called Vanadium tetracyanoethylene V(TCNE). V(TCNE)'s most interesting property are its long lived magnetic excitations, when quantized these excitations are called magnons and they have proven themselves to be useful in the race to qunatum use. 

When I'm not in the lab I enjoy taking long walks, trying out new recipes, and reading books and Wikipedia.
